### Tagline
Dying boy (13) cons his friends to help him escape from the hospital so that he can fulfill his last wish; one more night with his friends.  

(If you're wondering why the heck this screenplay is on Github or you don't know anything about git, repos or fountain – see noob section below.)

## Noob

#### Fountain Syntax

This script is written in a Fountain which is a plain text markdown language for film, TV and theater screenplays. As long as you follow the Fountain Syntax, you can edit the screenplay in any editor for plain text – although software dedicated to Fountain syntax (or one with a Fountain plugin), gives a superior writing experience. To see some options, see this [link](https://fountain.io/apps).

#### Git:octocat:
Git is software for version control of computer code. Just like computer code, a Fountain screenplay is a set of instructions according to a standardized format, and can hence utilize the same powerful tools used by software developers.
